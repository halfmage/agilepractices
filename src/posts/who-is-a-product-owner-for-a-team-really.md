> According to the [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/), a **Scrum Product Owner (PO)** is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team. How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.

Moreover, it is also mentioned there, that the scrum team consists of a Product Owner, Scrum Master, and a Development Team and at the same time underlined that they all are **equal team members**. The Development team itself can be represented by coding, testing engineers, designers, business analysts, etc. But what is more important is that in agile books PO is a person who is on the same “level of power” as any other member. 

There are even no levels in agile. And we agree with that point because levels of power hinder creativity, which leads to less productive problem-solving and further to less performance in general. Which every company wants to avoid if they are focused on the profit increase.

#### Actual responsibilities

A product owner is one of the roles for an individual who takes care of the business part, i.g. who is taking to all involved people and understands the need of customers. At the very end, after gathering the incomes from the stakeholders and customers he/she decided which features in a developed product could address their needs.

As the bridge between the dev team and customers, the PO must communicate and work closely with both groups to guarantee and reassure there is an understanding of what functionalities are expected in the product or application by the users. So to say, the Product Owner is a communicator and filter between engineers and users. He/she does not just pass the feedback of the customers directly to developers but also filter if it makes sense and if this specifically requested feature is a need for a majority of the customers. As there could be a great number of customer types, the product owner possesses a clear understanding of a business domain and the changing needs of different types of customers.

The PO prioritizes the user stories in the backlog based on the feedback from stakeholders and the development team and assures that the team knows what stories to work on first within the planned sprint. The product owner is responsible for helping to clarify any business details during the development process.

Scrum product owner responsibilities **include:**

* Defining the features of the software.
* Prioritizing features in the backlog.
* Updating open (non-developed) features and priority as needed after each sprint or iteration in a product backlog.
* Accepting or rejecting artifacts.
* Keeping customers updated about the status of the software and get their feedback.

The scrum guide doesn't tell anything about the Product Owner taking care of resources and guiding team members in their career development (as usually, talent leads are doing). Some companies that are on the way to digital transformation are trying to shift previously working hierarchical relations between employees into agile, the horizontal one, where are only roles, not levels of power.
