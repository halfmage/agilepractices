3 years ago my group mate (and a good friend of mine) and I started a small startup “Trustyquote” to unite IT companies with businesses across the EU and countries of Eastern Europe. After 9 months of intense research and communication with potential customers, we realize that the EU market, for instance, the German market, was not ready for this idea. Yet. So we paused working on this project.

Days after days, years after years, I didn’t have any business ideas worth paying attention to. They say that personal pains are the best trigger to create a new business idea. This is what happens to me.

The idea of my second startup came from real-life. I love quizzes very much, and I am participating in pub quizzes in Düsseldorf organized in the Russian language. It was not possible to invite to this quiz other friends who don’t speak Russian. But apparently, every foreigner cannot just stick to only one language, especially only your mother tongue, while living abroad. I have a lot of international friends and speak 3 languages every day. Literally, every day!

Thus, to gather all my international friends at house parties and play the quiz there is also impossible. Thus, I got an idea that could solve this problem, for instance, a quiz game available in different languages at the same time for all friends and family. Let me introduce our precious website — [Qizify](https://www.qizify.com/).

We were working according to the standard startup development process:

1. research
2. proof of concept
3. development
4. incremental releases
5. constant improvement of technology and business value.

At the beginning of October 2020, we have [released a website](https://www.qizify.com/). Do you think it is already over? No, fortunately (or unfortunately for someone) this is just the beginning. At the moment we are in the very last stage — constant improvement.

There are many steps ahead of me to improve, develop, and make the life of our customers better. And that is exactly what inspires me to move forward!

Small remark from wiki about me and entrepreneurs of my age:

> [The term “millennial entrepreneur”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship) refers to a business owner who is affiliated with the generation that was brought up using digital technology and mass media — the products of Baby Boomers, those people born during the 1980s and early 1990s. Also known as Generation Y, these business owners are well equipped with knowledge of new technology and new business models and have a strong grasp of its business applications. There have been many breakthrough businesses that have come from millennial entrepreneurs such as Mark Zuckerberg, who created Facebook.
