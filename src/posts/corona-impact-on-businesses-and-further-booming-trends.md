Pandemics and the fact that a lot of people were not able to work at all or without the possibility to do the job from home damaged the European economy severely. In the picture below it is seen that the majority of the countries are in a recession after about a year of pandemic situation. The only major economy to grow in 2020 was **China**. [It registered a growth of 2.3%](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55699971).

Economic recovery from the corona crisis is going to be the main topic for the current and coming year, if not for consecutive 10 years. Each failed company and the ones who benefited during corona set it all to the technological development.

#### **Companies lost profits** and employees during corona react with new business models.

As the pandemic can and, unfortunately, will still be present in 2021, each company that has been existentially tormented by corona should make up the mind and come up with a new plan. Restaurants can involve delivery services with online platforms whereas event-companies can transform into streaming platforms. 

The “As-a-Service” Economy replaces the previous investments to manage the danger within the potential unclean economic scenario. For instance, a delivery service would now not purchase or lease its delivery vehicles as before, however would pay the vehicle manufacturer per km or delivery, which is usually stated as Equipment-as-a-Service. Moreover, restaurants in Germany are under big pressure caused “monopoly” online order and delivery platform as Lieferando. This is the only popular platform nowadays to support restaurants with the digitalized services. Unfortunately, this support costs a lot. Lieferando receives up to 30% of the total order price as a fee. Not bad, right? This monopolized behaviour triggers the competition, thus, more and more order-and-delivery services will be delivered in the future.

The European economy, however, was still doing relatively well within the past crises that it'd not have dared to form radical changes to its IT. Hopefully, this will differ this time. A part of the EU economy is being hit by the pandemic and therefore the hyper-scalers have now absolutely enforced the EU privacy necessities. As a result, we tend to expect at the start an equivalent result in Europe in 2021 as was the case within the USA in 2013, 2015, and 2018.

### Companies that managed to float on the wave of profit during corona tend to invest proactively in their technological innovations.

We mustn't forget that a lot of industries have benefited staggeringly from the pandemic. This includes online retailers (like Amazon), provision firms (SaaS platforms), delivery services (like Lieferando), and every business that was focused on manufacturing and distributing protection clothing and hygiene products. The IT sector is additionally booming, with video services, network element suppliers, and telecommunications firms. All those who got profit in 2020-2021 will invest massively in 2021 the business model of innovation and technological development, to prepare themselves proactively for the new competitive scenario once corona is over. Nowadays, trendy Circular Economy can play a crucial role within the business models and, for instance in B2B, can yield new deposit and packaging solutions that bring additional price with IoT Tracing. More focus on Recycling and sustainability is visible in big corporations like Vodafone. Companies are working on using the resources efficiently and reuse them as much as possible.

Overall, the corona winning companies are going to be able to invest in each domain and booming technology. In areas with not many inhabitants, the first delivery drones are being deployed as prototypes, which will then spread productively in 2022.

Summarizing this article into one important phase, I believe that the world will never be the same again as if corona was not there. Companies and governments will invest more into digitalization so that the economy does not suffer from unexpected pandemic situations in the future (which might come in the near future again). Unfortunately, more active digitalization should have happened without corona, but as a natural logical step of business development. 

*But we have what we have got.*
