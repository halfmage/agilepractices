        Hey guys, I am Alesia, and this is a blog about Agile practices, SCRUM, Kanban and other sexy IT-related topics. Posts will be written by me and my friends and colleagues who work in IT industry all over the world. Let’s exchange our thoughts and think how we can move the industry forward.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-primary-400 font-bold">About me</h2>
      <p>I am originally from Minsk, Belarus. Had a chance to start my IT-career there and kick-start my IT-path. In 2014, I have moved to Germany and did my Master in IT-Project Management and continued working in Trivago and later at Vodafone.</p>
      <p>My main goal is dedication to my work and experience. Communication with partners, new solutions and creativity in working process, flexible attitude in each case – this is what gives me strength each day.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I’m absolutely sure that our bright future depends only on our efforts and on us as a whole. Smart, talented, inspired and fascinated by their work people are half the battle of the successful projects. Agree?</p>
      <p>Let’s build a solid Agile community together and learn from each other!</p>
